This project involves creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI) calculator using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key features of the calculator include:

A display area to show the input expression and results.
Numeric and operator buttons for user input.
A clear button to reset the input field.
An equals button that evaluates the input expression using Python's eval() function.
The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of GUI development in Python, such as creating buttons, handling button clicks, and managing user input, while also providing a practical tool for performing arithmetic calculations.
